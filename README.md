Here is the article that I used: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow

In this artle I learned to design typography.  This artle instructed me on how to add text shadow and text transperency to texts.  A simple text-shadow syntax consists of four variables.  Other shadows must be seperated by a comma.  Text shadow is supported in most browsers.

The article was pretty straight forward.  It was helpful to me because it explained the syntax of text-shadow.  It also gave me specific step-by-step examples of how to do it.  This article linked the examples to external websites which allowed me to visually see the html and css files.  It would be more helpful if the article included external examples of text-shadows in action.  This article was fairly easy to follow.  I am a beginner with html and CSS, so I know other beginners can learn this.  The article was user friendly and everything was well organized.  It's nice to see everyone that contributed to the article.  This article will be another resource for me while I learn HTML and CSS.
